The photo is quite obviously the golden gate bridge, but the problem is asking where the photo was taken **from**.

From google maps and a bit of streetview we can see that it's likely taken from the H Dana Bowers Memorial Vista Point.

The example format of `DUCTF{a_b_c_d_example}` was a little confusing, as I thought they wanted the first 4 words' initials only.
